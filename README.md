# SPRING RABBITMQ
### Projects
* This repo includes personal projects to work on and understand rabbitmq.
```
.
├── README.md
├── RabbitListener  
├── RabbitRetryProject  
├── SpringRabbitStreamConsumer  
├── SpringRabbitStreamProducer  
└── rabbitmqdemo  
```

* Firstly, a project is created only to send message via Postman.
```bash
└── rabbitmqdemo  
```


* To understand rabbitmq exchanges we need to understand differences from each other. Best way to understand exchanges comparing each other by trying out.
```bash
├── RabbitListener  
└── rabbitmqdemo  
```


**_NOTE:_**  Sorry about some namings, I was just trying rabbitmq. Sometimes I changed projects' goal in the middle of projects.


* To understand rabbitmq error handling and retry. I have created another project. I have used same controller sender project.
```bash
├── RabbitRetryProject  
└── rabbitmqdemo  
```


* To understand publishing and consuming via rabbitmq stream I have created these two projects.
```bash
├── SpringRabbitStreamConsumer  
├── SpringRabbitStreamProducer  
```

**_NOTE:_**  Aware some deprecated codes on stream projects. These are just to understand concepts.
